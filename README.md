This library derives from the 
[Stm32Duino VL53L1X Arduino Library](https://github.com/stm32duino/VL53L1X), q.v. for details.

I made the following modifications:

* Made the library header-only

* Replaced ```#define``` with typed static constants

* Added support for non-Arduino platforms via subclassing
